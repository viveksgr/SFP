## Run basic decoding and SVM

This example provides instructions to run SVM decoding to predict odor identity using sniffing parameters.
1. Open sfp_decoding.m and change variable mainroot to the directory of the repository
2. Add libsvm to filepath
3. Run sfp_decoding.m

It should produce SVM results similar to the boxp.fig and svm.fig
Results may very slightly differ because of stochasticity and noise.
